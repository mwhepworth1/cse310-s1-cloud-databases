## Software Description
We are aiming to create a web-based to do list application that communicates with a SQL server (preferably PostgreSQL or MySQL). The goal is to design a user interface that enables a visitor to register an account, log in to their account, create multiple different to-do lists, and modify each list. Each one of these requests will be funneled back to an API server that acts as the man in the middle between our server/webserver and our database. 

## Architecture
Python / Flask
PostgreSQL
Bootstrap (CSS & JS) for frontend
Visual Studio Code
GitHub Repo & Project Boards
python-dotenv
